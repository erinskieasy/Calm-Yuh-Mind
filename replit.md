## System Architecture
Serenity utilizes a modern full-stack architecture with a clear separation of concerns.

### UI/UX Decisions
- **Design System**: Shadcn UI with Radix primitives, Tailwind CSS, custom design system.
- **Color Palette**: Calming Sage Green, Soft Sky Blue (light mode background), Deep Navy (dark mode background), with accent blues and greens.
- **Typography**: Outfit for headings, Inter for body text, with a responsive font scale.
- **Spacing**: Generous and consistent spacing (e.g., `p-4`, `gap-4`) for reduced cognitive load.
- **Theme System**: Four custom gradient themes with full CSS variable definitions:
  - **Default**: Original calming sage and sky blue palette
  - **Midnight Breeze**: Light blue to deep midnight gradient for tranquility and reflection
  - **Tropical Sunset**: Warm sunset oranges and reds for energy and optimism
  - **Meadow Fields**: Fresh meadow greens for growth and renewal
  - Themes persist via localStorage and apply site-wide with smooth transitions

### Technical Implementations
- **Frontend**: React 18 with TypeScript, Wouter for routing, TanStack Query v5 for server state, Recharts for visualizations, Framer Motion for animations, Tiptap rich text editor.
- **Backend**: Express.js server with Multer for file uploads (custom sounds, journal images).
- **Authentication**: Replit Auth integration supporting multiple providers (Google, GitHub, X, Apple, email/password) with secure, session-based authentication persisted in PostgreSQL. All application features require authentication, and user data is isolated.
- **AI Integration**: OpenAI API (GPT-4o-mini + Whisper) via Replit AI Integrations for a compassionate AI companion with conversation history persistence. Features three voice interaction modes:
  - **(1) Voice-to-text input**: Quick voice-to-text with automatic AI voice response using Web Speech API
  - **(2) Voice note recording**: Users record audio (MediaRecorder captures webm), audio uploaded to server, OpenAI Whisper transcribes on backend, AI receives transcription and responds. Voice notes stored with playable audio in chat history and display the transcribed text.
  - **(3) Text-to-speech output**: AI responses spoken aloud using Web Speech Synthesis API (works for both text and voice note responses)
  - Voice notes display as playable audio messages with native HTML5 audio controls and transcribed text in chat history
  - Server-side Whisper transcription ensures accuracy and triggers AI responses
  - Text chat enhanced with empathetic, varied responses using higher temperature setting (0.8) and improved system prompt for natural, personalized conversations
- **Assessment Tools**: Comprehensive collection of 6 validated mental health screening tools (PHQ-9, GAD-7, PSS-10, Rosenberg Self-Esteem, UCLA Loneliness, PCL-5 Short) with randomized question presentation, auto-advancing flows, color-coded score interpretation, proper reverse scoring, and historical tracking.
- **Therapist Directory**: Interactive OpenStreetMap-based therapist finder with live location support. Uses browser Geolocation API to pinpoint user location, integrates with Overpass API to query OpenStreetMap for mental health professionals (psychotherapists, psychiatrists, mental health clinics) within a configurable radius (1-20km). Displays results on interactive map with markers, popups showing contact details, and visual search radius indicator.
- **Global Audio Context**: React Context API provides persistent audio playback across all pages with centralized state management for volume and track selection.

### Feature Specifications
- **Dashboard**: Real-time statistics, 7-day mood trend.
- **Mood Tracker**: Log daily moods with intensity, notes, and a 30-day visual calendar with daily averaging. When multiple moods are logged on the same day, the system calculates a weighted average based on mood values (joyful=5, calm=4, neutral=3, anxious=2, sad=1) and intensities. Calendar displays the average mood with color coding and entry count badges. Dialog shows both daily average and all individual entries with timestamps.
- **Digital Journal**: Rich HTML editor powered by Tiptap with full formatting capabilities (bold, italic, underline, headings, lists, alignment), image upload support (10MB limit, JPEG/PNG/GIF/WebP), and chronological timeline display.
